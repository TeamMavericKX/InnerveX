## 🚀 LAUNCH SEQUENCE

### Pre-Submission (Build Hype)

#### Post 1: The Teaser (3 days before)

**Twitter/X:**
```
Something big is coming... 👀

We've been working on a $18 device that could change how the 
world thinks about IoT security.

Stay tuned. 🔒

#IoT #Cybersecurity #ComingSoon
```

**LinkedIn:**
```
Over the past 6 months, our team has been building something 
that addresses a problem most people don't even know exists.

Firmware attacks.

83% of enterprises have experienced them. Average detection 
time? 207 days.

We're about to change that. Demo video drops this week.

Stay tuned for FIRM-LOCK. 🔒
```

#### Post 2: The Problem (2 days before)

**Twitter/X:**
```
🧵 THREAD: The invisible threat to every connected device

You know about viruses, ransomware, phishing.

But there's a attack vector that's 10x more dangerous—and 
almost nobody talks about it.

Firmware attacks.

Here's why they should scare you 👇

1/7
```

**Thread Continuation:**
```
2/ Firmware loads BEFORE your operating system.

That means it has total control. It can:
• See everything
• Modify anything
• Hide from antivirus

By the time your OS boots, the damage is done.

3/ Firmware attacks are PERSISTENT.

Reinstall your OS? The firmware survives.
Replace your hard drive? The firmware survives.
Factory reset? The firmware survives.

It's the digital equivalent of a cockroach.

4/ They're also INVISIBLE.

Traditional security tools run on the OS.
They literally cannot see firmware.

An attacker could own your device for MONTHS and you'd 
never know.

5/ The stats are terrifying:

• 83% of enterprises hit by firmware attacks
• 5x increase from 2019-2021
• Average detection: 207 DAYS
• Cost per breach: $4.45M

And it's getting worse.

6/ So why don't we hear about it?

Because until recently, firmware attacks required 
sophisticated nation-state capabilities.

Not anymore. Tools are leaking. Barriers are dropping.

The threat is democratizing.

7/ What can you do?

Most people: nothing. It's hard to detect, harder to prevent.

But we're building something that changes the game.

Demo drops tomorrow. Follow for FIRM-LOCK. 🔒

### Submission Day (GO TIME)

#### Post 3: The Launch

**Twitter/X:**
```
🚀 IT'S LIVE! 🚀

We just submitted FIRM-LOCK to @[Hackathon]!

A $18 device that detects firmware attacks in 2 seconds 
(instead of 207 days).

🎥 Demo: [link]
💻 Code: [link]
📊 Dashboard: [link]

RT to save a device from firmware attacks 🔒

🚀 EXCITING NEWS! 🚀

Our team just submitted FIRM-LOCK to [Hackathon Name], and 
we couldn't be prouder of what we've built.

THE PROBLEM:
Firmware attacks are invisible, persistent, and devastating.
• 83% of enterprises have been hit
• Average detection time: 207 days
• OS reinstall doesn't remove them

THE SOLUTION:
FIRM-LOCK provides hardware-backed attestation for IoT devices.
• Detects tampering in under 2 seconds
• Works offline via LoRa/BLE/USB
• Costs just $18/device
• Fully open source

WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT:
While solutions like Azure Sphere require constant cloud 
connectivity, FIRM-LOCK works anywhere—even air-gapped 
environments.

We're the ONLY solution that brings enterprise-grade trust 
to resource-constrained edge devices.

CHECK IT OUT:
🎥 Demo Video: [link]
💻 GitHub Repo: [link]
📊 Live Dashboard: [link]

This is just the beginning. We're already in talks with 
defense contractors and have applied for SBIR funding.

The future of IoT security is verifiable. The future is 
FIRM-LOCK.

#### Post 4: The Demo Hook

**Twitter/X:**
```
🎥 Watch this 30-second demo of FIRM-LOCK:

0:00 - Device is healthy ✅
0:10 - Attacker flashes malicious firmware ⚠️
0:15 - FIRM-LOCK detects it in 1.2s 🔍
0:20 - Device automatically recovers 🛡️
0:25 - Back to trusted state ✅

Full video: [link]

This is what 207 days → 2 seconds looks like.

### Post-Submission (Keep Momentum)

#### Post 5: The Technical Deep-Dive

**Twitter/X:**
```
🧵 How FIRM-LOCK works (technical but accessible):

1️⃣ Secure Element stores unclonable device identity
   • Private key NEVER leaves the chip
   • Hardware tamper detection
   • $0.58 cost

2️⃣ Bootloader measures every piece of code
   • SHA-256 hashes at each boot stage
   • Extends into PCRs (Platform Config Registers)
   • Any change = different hash

3️⃣ Attestation Agent signs evidence
   • Collects PCRs + nonce
   • Signs with secure element
   • Sends to verifier

4️⃣ Verifier checks against golden values
   • Validates signature
   • Checks nonce freshness
   • Compares PCRs
   • PASS or FAIL

Result: Provable integrity in <2 seconds.
